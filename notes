								<h1>Hospitality & <br>Recruitment</h1>
								<p>Customer Service Africa is a hospitality and Recruitment company that is primarily established to promote hospitality
								customer service and to recruit skilled professionals for the industry in Africa. Customer Service Africa was born out
								of poor delivery of services to our guests/customers across Africa especially in the hospitality and tourism sector
								which should rather be the leader of great customer service, customer satisfaction and customer experience.</p>

								<h1>In recent times...</h1>
								<p> ...the hospitality industry and corporate organizations are faced with bad customer service due to customer complaints and
								generally unhappy customers due to the lack of skilled, passionate and customer-oriented professionals for the job. It
								is for the reason that CSA seeks to provide the perfect opportunity for the hospitality and corporate organizations
								(Hotels, Airlines, Cooperate Organizations and Startups) to really appreciate the importance of customer service in
								their establishments and invest in their training. </p>
